# History.
Below is just historical rambling for non-technical folks to understand what we are trying to accomplish. In short, we want to remove money from politics lowering the cost of entry to almost zero.

Great historical explanation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammany_Hall<BR>
Martin Scorsese made a movie that illustrated the power of the Society of St. Tammany while everyone was fighting: https://youtu.be/NUco72Sxokk

Two hundred years later, we are still fighting while the party bosses pick candidates.<BR>
